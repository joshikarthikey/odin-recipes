# My First Web Project for The Odin Project

## Primary Goal

To apply all the basic HTML in an actual Project. I know it won't look fancy but at least it's mineüòÅ.

## What am I going to make??
1. [x]  **Iteration 1:** Make index.html with usual HTML boilerplate and an h1 heading.
2. [x]  **Iteration 2:** Make a separate directory for all the recipes and add HTML file for it with usual Boilerplate code and links to and from all the recipe page to the home page.
3. [x]  **Iteration 3:** Add the recipe Page content.
4. [x]  **Iteration 4:** Add more recipes
